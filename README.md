# iank.online

This site is a static html page that runs on the NGinx web server my OpenWRT LTE router. The iank.online DNS record is updated when my router logs into the internet, and the site is then hosted from the Router's NGinx web server plugin.

This means that when I am online, using my computer and hot-spot in a mobile location, I am readily and easily accessible through the <https://iank.online> website.

This gives peers, co-workers, family members, and others a small web portal to get in touch with me in the ways I am plugged into online.
